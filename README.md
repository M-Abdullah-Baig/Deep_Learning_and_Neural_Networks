## 1) Cat Image Recognition Classifier Using Neural Network Architecture

The main goal of this project is to create a smart system that can look at pictures and accurately decide if there's a cat in them or not. To do this, we're using a special computer model called a neural network, teaching it to understand the important details in cat and non-cat images. This involves showing it lots of examples so it can learn by itself. We want the system to be really good at spotting cats, even in different poses or lighting. The idea is that once it's trained, it can look at new pictures and tell us if there's a cat in them or not, making it useful for various real-life situations.

We begin by setting up tools, understanding the task, and breaking the process into smaller parts. This involves creating helper functions, handling math operations, initializing parameters, and making the system learn and improve. The ultimate aim is to build an effective model for cat image recognition.
